## OpenGL2 Virtual Science Museum

scimus is demonstration of OpenGL2 technologies that I wrote for an introductory course in computer graphics.  It is essentially a first-person navigation demo with various animations that are intended to follow the theme of a virtual science museum.

scimus demonstrates the following concepts:

* First-person navigation.  This is encapsulated in the navigation module and may be useful for other OpenGL projects.

* Colored ambient, specular & diffuse lighting along with alpha blending.

* Animations, including planetary motion with Kepler's laws and the motion of a virtual piston, which required various trigonometric calculations.

* Textures, found on the ceilings and outside the window.

* Rudimentary collision detection (with the walls only).

* Displaying a sophisticated model (a DNA molecule).
